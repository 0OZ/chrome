# 1.0.0

ü•Å -- Stable version 1.0 is here! While this doesn't include major functionality changes, it _does_ change how the docker builds are generated going forward. The versioning will now contain two pieces of crucial information: the version of the _browserless_ service + the version of Chrome under-the-hood. For instance `1.2.3-puppeteer-1.10.0` is browserless at `1.2.3`, exposing puppeteer at `1.10.0`.

Similar to how NodeJS itself does docker releases, we'll now provide releases in 3 distinct ways:

- An _immutable_, pinned version release: `1.0.0-puppeteer-1.11.0`
- A mutable minor version release: `1.1-puppeteer-1.12.0`
- A mutable major version release: `1-puppeteer-1.9.0`

For production deployments, we recommend using _pinned_ version releases as they won't change once released. The mutable minor/major releases will receive on-going updates whenever we do changes that are bug-fixes or feature release. Even with the best intentions it's possible that instability can be introduced with these mutable images, hence why recommend the pinned version releases.

Finally, we'll continue to ship support for the last 5 minor versions of Puppeteer + the Google Chrome (stable). Old images will remain, but newer versions of browserless won't be included.

We'll continue to keep this changelog up-to-date anytime we do docker releases.
